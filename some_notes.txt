Some notes

<Request and Response>

So you are at home and you want to watch some youtube.
Assuming you are connected to the internet with your local isp
your computer will talk to your isp's DNS server(Domain Name Server)
DNS Servers don't hold webpage files but they associate domain names
with a particular ip address. So say the first DNS server doesn't know
where www.youtube.com so it goes off and asks another DNS server
which lets say it does know will message back the first DNS Server
"Hey the IP address for youtube is 12.3.4.56" which will cache that
info and then send the info back to my computer.

Now I know the IP address of youtube, then my computer connects with the hosting server.
My computer makes a request to the hosting server and the response I get is in the
form of a webpage


You make the request in forms of http headers and the server will respond
with some http response headers and some content (HTTP,CSS etc)

<HTML Notes>

so for <img src... alt=... title=.... > 
alt is for when the image can't load and the alt text will be loaded
title is when mouse hover over the image and the text will appear

Head usage:Denotes the section of the HTML document that contains the title, metadata, and other browser related script, css, and shortcut icon links.


Body usage: Denotes the section of the HTML document that contains all of the visible page content such as images, text, links, and page layout.


In HTML5, semantic elements got introduced so instead of using a thousand divs you can 
now use tags such as <section> <nav> <article> <header> <footer> etc so you don't lose
your tags in the sea of divs
