Some notes

<Request and Response>

So you are at home and you want to watch some youtube.
Assuming you are connected to the internet with your local isp
your computer will talk to your isp's DNS server(Domain Name Server)
DNS Servers don't hold webpage files but they associate domain names
with a particular ip address. So say the first DNS server doesn't know
where www.youtube.com so it goes off and asks another DNS server
which lets say it does know will message back the first DNS Server
"Hey the IP address for youtube is 12.3.4.56" which will cache that
info and then send the info back to my computer.

Now I know the IP address of youtube, then my computer connects with the hosting server.
My computer makes a request to the hosting server and the response I get is in the
form of a webpage


You make the request in forms of http headers and the server will respond
with some http response headers and some content (HTTP,CSS etc)
